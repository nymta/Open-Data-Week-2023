# MTA Public Metrics Website Presentation: Open Data Week 2023

## Getting started

On Thursday, March 16 from 1 PM to 2 PM, staff from MTA's Data & Analytics team will give a presentation ([register here!](https://2023.open-data.nyc/event/visualizing-mta-performance-data-with-python/)) on how you can use Python to easily analyze data from [MTA's open data program](https://new.mta.info/open-data), and visualize it on webppages similar to MTA's [public metrics website](https://metrics.mta.info/).

To help prepare for this demonstration, we've prepared a list of steps you should follow prior to the session. They walk you through downloading software needed for the session, and testing the software to make sure everything's working.

## Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook Download instructions

Python is the programming language we use to prepare data for and create [metrics.mta.info](metrics.mta.info), and what you'll use in this demonstration. Anaconda is a 'distribution' of Python. Downloading Anaconda lets you use Python, as well as other useful programs for programming in Python.

If you already have Python installed and a code-editing software set-up, you can skip to the [Installing Packages in the Terminal](#installing-packages-in-the-terminal) section.

### Step 1

Download this repository by clicking the "Code" button, and then the "Download Zip" button beneath that.

### Step 2

Extract the `open-data-week-2023` folder to somewhere in your computer by clicking or double-clicking it, and hitting the "Extract All" button.

### Step 3

Go to [this link](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) and download Anaconda.

### Step 4

If you go to the Downloads folder on your computer, you should see the Anaconda installer there. It should look something like this:

![image-5.png](./src/images/image-5.png)

Double click on that, and then you’ll be prompted through a number of steps to install Anaconda on your computer. Go through all of the steps until the installation is complete.

### Step 5

Once you finish Step 2, Anaconda will be downloaded on your computer.  The icon for the app will look like this:

![image-6.png](./src/images/image-6.png)

Open the application.

### Step 6

Once you open Anaconda-Navigator, the interface should look similar to this:

![image-7.png](./src/images/image-7.png)

### Step 7

Click on “Launch” under the VS Code square. VS Code is a code-editor that we'll use to edit and run our Python scripts.

![image-8.png](./src/images/image-8.png)

It should pop up a new window like this:

![image-9.png](./src/images/image-9.png)

### Step 8

Click on Open Folder. Then navigate to the `open-data-week-2023` file in the folder, click on the folder named , and click "select folder." 

![](./src/images/vscode-workspace.PNG)

This will set this folder as your workspace. You should be able to see what files are available in this folder on the left-hand side of your screen.

### Step 9

VSCode has extensions that make programming using Python easier. You can install extensions by clicking on the "Extensions" button on the left hand side.

![](./src/images/extensions.PNG)

You should search for and install the following extensions:

 - Python
 - Jupyter

## Installing Packages in the Terminal

Before creating a webpage, you need to have certain packages installed. Python programmers often use packages, which contain useful functions and methods for programming. What you will need to is:

### Step 1

Open a new terminal in VS Code by clicking "Terminal -> New Terminal." The terminal is a command-line interface that lets you interact directly with your computer; we'll use it to download packages and deploy the website. You should see the terminal menu at the top of your screen:

![](src/images/new_terminal.PNG)

### Step 2

One of the main packages we used to make [metrics.mta.info](metrics.mta.info) is called streamlit. You can install streamlit by copying or typing `pip install streamlit` into the terminal and hitting the `Enter` key. Like so:
 
![](./src/images/image-11.PNG)

The website (and this demonstration) also uses other packages; you can install them all by copying this into the terminal, and hitting enter. On a Windows computer, you can paste into the terminal with `shift + insert`:

 `pip install pandas altair streamlit-aggrid datetime`

### Step 3

Now to finally see if you're able to run the program:

Type `streamlit run app.py` in the terminal. As so:

![](./src/images/streamlit_run.PNG)

Once this is completed. You should be able to see a web browser open up:

![image-13.png](./src/images/hello_world.PNG)

### You're Done!!

If you didn't succeed that is totally okay! We will be go over any questions you have on this during our session.

See you then! :wave:

## Troubleshooting

Here are some issues you may run into, and how you might try to address them. If these don't work, don't worry; we'll save some time at the start of the session for further troubleshooting.

### I can't download any Python packages using the terminal

If you're getting error messages when you try to install Python packages, try the following:

1) Make sure you're opening VS Code from Anaconda. Anaconda automatically activates Python in your VS Code terminal when you open it. You can tell by the `conda activate` command that automatically runs when you open VS Code, and (if you're using a command prompt) by the environment name appearing at the start of your command line.

2) If you're still not seeing anything, try hitting `ctrl+shift+p`, and searching for "Python: Select Interpreter." Then select a Python interpreter, and open a new terminal in VS Code.

    ![](src/images/py_interp.PNG)

3) Another option you can try is `python pip install [package names]`, or `py pip install [package names]`.

4) Sometimes on Windows computers, VS Code will activate a Windows PowerShell command-line shell rather than the Command Prompt terminal. Occasionally, PowerShell won't recognize that Python is installed while the Command Prompt will. You can change your default terminal by hitting `ctrl+shift+p`, searching for "Terminal: Select Default Profile," and selecting the Command Prompt. Then, start a new terminal

### When I try to run `streamlit run app.py`, it returns an error

It may be a filepath issue. Make sure that in VS Code, you use "file --> open folder," and open the `mta-open-data-week-2023` folder, so that the folder is set as your workspace and the terminal knows where to look for the `app.py` file.
